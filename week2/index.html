                <p>Julie Han was born in Seoul, South Korea, as the only daughter of Jeongmee Lee and Kyungjoon Han.<sup>1</sup> Until the age of five, she lived with her grandparents in the southern suburbs of Seoul. Before attending elementary school, she joined a children's sports center where she learned swimming until the age of eight.
                <p>Her life as an elementary student was rather normal, just like other kids.<sup>2</sup> While mostly spent her time on the playground or on reading books, She was also greatly influenced by her parents who loved music. She started to learn to play the piano at the age of five, and the violin at the age of seven. She continued to play both instruments until she attended college, where she joined an amateur orchestra as a violinist.
                <p>Her father, a devoted Christian, wanted his daughter to attend a Christian school. Therefore, she spent six years in secondary school at Girls Christian School in Seoul. During this time, she began to contemplate on religion and philosophy, which have had a significant impact on human society throughout thousands of years, yet in very diverse contexts. This sparked her hope to learn more about human activities and thoughts from the past. Her parents, both history graduates, were another great influence on her decision to study history.
                <p>She attended Seoul National University, where she majored in Asian History.<sup>3</sup> However, four years of studying history in college were not enough. She wanted to delve deeper, especially into the social and cultural histories of Early China, where many of the thoughts and practices that shaped East Asia originated. She decided to pursue a master's degree in Asian History at the same university.

                While in graduate school, she met a man named Andrew, who was her cousin's superior in the military. After three years of dating, they got married in 2020, during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, she didn't expect to study abroad, but her husband wanted to apply for an MBA program in the United States. Thus, she also applied to several history PhD programs in the US, where she finally setteld in New York University.

                <p>The history we learn in school—divided into four chapters of politics, economy, society, and culture—devotes to narrating the deeds of kings and the evolution of systems. Reading textbooks that overlooked the actual people who lived under these reigns and systems, she wondered how commoners reacted in 221 BC when the Qin defeated the Qi and finally unified China. Just as Bertolt Brecht asks in his poem Questions from a <em>Worker Who Reads</em> (1935), <strong>“Where, the evening that the Great Wall of China was finished, did the masons go?”</strong>
                <p>Her interest in the history of people, particularly the marginalized—women, children, the disabled, barbarians, and many others—stemmed from this question. Like the anecdote of Menocchio, the miller in The Cheese and the Worms (1976)<sup>4</sup>, which revealed the realities of 16th-century European religious reform, she seeks to uncover the vivid and multi-dimensional realities of early East Asia. With a particular focus on early China, she aims to explore the beliefs and practices of people who have been largely underrepresented in conventional historiography and to examine how their everyday lives were shaped by political, cultural, and religious contexts.
                <p>Primarily focusing on legal and administrative bamboo slips, such as those from Shuihudi, Zhangjiashan, and Yuelu, she devoted her time at Seoul National University to studying the local governance of the Qin and Han empires. Her research was made possible by access to the latest excavated manuscripts while participating in a reading seminar under the guidance of Professor Byung-Joon Kim. She gained valuable insights from interacting with visiting sinologists, including Dr. Chen Wei 陳偉 and Dr. Itaru Tomiya 富谷 至, as well as from graduate student feedback on her presentation at Beijing Normal University titled “The Duty of Ancient Chinese Officials in the Judicial Administration.”
                <p>Her continuous efforts since undergraduate studies to acquire language skills—such as Chinese, Japanese, and Classical Chinese—enhanced her ability to decipher excavated manuscripts and comprehend both primary and secondary sources. In addition, she explored different approaches to history instruction while reading Shiji and the Analects with undergraduate students as a teaching assistant, working as a researcher for a historical documentary film, and writing as a freelance contributor for children’s world history books. In recognition of her dedication to the field, she was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship for the prospective Ph.D. program in Fall 2023.
                <p>Her master's thesis, titled “The Changes in the Policy of the Qin and Han Empires on the Elderly and the Weak,” allowed her to engage more deeply with the history of those most vulnerable to alienation in institutional-centered narratives. She demonstrated that the protection of the vulnerable—the aged, infirm, widowed, and orphaned—gradually shifted from government responsibility to the public sphere as state power declined and Confucian values gained prominence.

                There are many things she has been interested in throughout her life. First and foremost, she loves music. Although she learned to play music herself, she quickly realized that she did not possess great talent as a performer. However, she enjoys curating music across diverse genres, including Classical, Jazz, R&B, and Electronic Dance Music. Since her 20s, she has attended numerous concerts and music festivals, including Coldplay, U2, and the Ultra Music Festival.
                She is also interested in music theory and history. In college, she took several courses on music history and philosophy and even considered becoming a producer in radio broadcasting. A few years ago, she developed an interest in MIDI music production and is eager to learn more about creating music professionally using a digital audio workstation.
