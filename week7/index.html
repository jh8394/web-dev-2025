        Digital humanities (DH) is an area of <span id="adj1">scholarly</span> activity at the intersection of <span id="noun1">computing</span> or <span id="adj2">digital</span> technologies and the disciplines of humanities. The <span id="noun2">definition</span> of the digital humanities is being continually formulated by scholars and practitioners. Since the <span id="noun3">field</span> is constantly growing and changing, specific definitions can quickly become outdated or unnecessarily limit future <span id="noun4">potential</span>.

        By producing and using <span id="adj3">new</span> <span id="noun5">applications</span> and techniques, DH makes new kinds of teaching possible, while at the same time studying and critiquing how these impact cultural heritage and digital culture. A distinctive feature of DH is its cultivation of a two-way <span id="noun6">relationship</span> between the humanities and the digital: the field both employs technology in the pursuit of humanities research and subjects <span id="noun7">technology</span> to <span id="adj4">humanistic</span> questioning and interrogation.
